1. Fields created from Protobuf fields (Aurora, BETTII's flight software)
2. The code is a tool to analyze the Attitude controls System estimator performance as well as any other information coming from the Telescope (Temperatures, power consumption, Griffin Angles, Mode of Operation, FPGA timing performance, etc.)
